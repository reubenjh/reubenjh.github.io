                <p>* <strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong>
                    <br>
                    My take on the EDA experience is that it's designed to train programmers who are kind, creative, inclusive and empathetic people first, who are able to learn how to learn, and to teach their peers and contribute to a collective conversation, then technical experts second. In that order. I really like the sounds of that.
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>What are your impressions?</strong>
                    <br>
                    When I kick off the fireside chat video with Sherif I see a majestic hairy man staring back at me, who reminds me in an instant all my fears and insecurities about programming: that I don't fit the bill - hell I don't even look the bill, I can't even grow whiskers and this guy looks like he could hide half a mochaccino in there, he looks like computer science majors from my past, he seems completely calm and confident and not nervous at all. He looks like a developer. But before the hour's out, I'm feeling happy and I just want to hug that big bear of a man. Good stuff Sherif.
                    <br><br>
                    The kitchen mindset is something I'm genuinely excited to get behind. I've spent the last two years in a figurative kitchen with my boss - who never really felt like a boss, more a cooking buddy and best friend with a passion to make the best stew together - and have been terrified to leave the kitchen for fear I'll find myself in the restaurant mindset of corporate work environments and never find a kitchen to feel at home in again. Clock in and clock out, serve the customers who complain their waiter hasn't showered in three days - screw that, i want to stay in the kitchen creating stuff in my pajamas with fellow self-expressed people who love to dream up a whole new way to use spinach and cashew nuts in a curry.
                    <br><br>
                    But, while that all sounds grand, it brings up a fear that wells in my throat every time i walk into the dev academy campus that i'm simply not smart enough. What kind of software developer spends 3 hours of their first full time study day trying to figure out how to git config and getting the response that they don't have the permission? Spooky metaphorical to the nervous mind if you ask me. Maybe i'm out of my depth?
                    <br><br>
                    So, when halfway through the video, John from Tampa asks how much someone's natural intelligence has to do with their ability to become a great developer, my ears prick up. It's like this wizard has read my mind. That's at the root of this pit I have in my stomach. Then old papa bear Sherif pauses a second before saying '5%? i dunno, not that much.', before going on to talk about the qualities that are far more important, like persistence, humility, and the ability to tolerate your own frustrations.
                    <br><br>
                    I can't help but chuckle when I hear him praise curiosity and a tinkering nature, I reckon whatever shortfall I might have in flat IQ fell right into the curiosity basket. There was this moment yesterday while learning command line that I got the biggest grin on my face:
                    <br><br>
                    codeacademy.com kept making me write nano ~/.bash_profile to edit environment variables in the wee little browser terminal window while going through the course, and that honestly is just a stupidly spaced set of characters to be strung together in something that so often needed to be typed there. So the moment I learnt how to make an alias in the bash profile I guessed it might work for that string of nonsense and wrote alias opensesame="nano ~/.bash_profile", closed nano and sourced the session. Like a computer Aladdin, i wrote opensesame in my terminal window and bang, it worked. For the rest of the course I was opensesame'ing up a storm, even when it wasn't efficient, just to see if I could shortcut the commands. It was small, but it felt huge.
                    <br><br>
                    So yeah, thanks John from Tampa for crystal-balling what I bet so many viewers would have been feeling, and thanks Sherif for the encouragement and that timeless quote "IQ is overrated". Tinkerers represent.

                    * <strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I see myself jumping in. I look forward to the challenge, to speak up and share my input even when i'm not 100% sure it's the right answer, to learn to teach at the same time as learning, and most importantly to develop my discipline. 
                    <br><br>
                    I have a habit of being a perfectionist - my mum always said "if you're gonna do it, do it right", but when I don't have the time to take a deep dive into everything and perfect my understanding and notes before moving on, I'm gonna have a bit of learning to do.
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Nope, the very first thing I did when thinking of doing EDA was to come in for a chat with Rohan, who sat me down and gave me the backstory and an understanding of the culture and the dreams the crew here have. And everything that's happened since then has been consistent with that. 
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Very. And yes. It's easy to sit in a lecture at uni, with a clear understanding of the teacher-student relationship, a list of assignments and a set grade to hit. But it's boring, and I've forgotten literally everything I learned in Spanish 112 other than what "como estas?" means. I'm nervous of being challenged in a public way, of being vulnerable, that I'll be the slowest to pick up the technical concepts in the room, and that I've only got 18 weeks before I'm applying for jobs in a field that is practicably in another language. But I want to smash that nervousness, and I want to make some spicy stuff in a kitchen with new buddies, learn tricks to make my computer opensesame, and have a shitload of fun.
                    <br><br>
                    Reuben.
