                <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
                <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
                <p>That emotional intelligence is a huge predictor of success in a bunch of ways. First of all, at predicting excellence at a task, second at predicting leadership capability, and most importantly to me, at predicting and creating personal happiness! I loved the words the author used to describe happiness: “a deep sense of flourishing that arises from an exceptionally healthy mind … not a mere pleasurable feeling, a fleeting emotion, or a mood, but an optimal state of being.” And I'm a big believer that from happiness all else stems.</p>
                <p>I love the very first point the chapter makes, that emotional intelligence is a learned ability. I feel like I might have lucked out a bit on that end as I was fortunate enough to grow up in a really caring and emotionally literate family where vulnerability was ok, and my big brother and I got to see empathy in action all the time so I got the chance to start learning young.</p>
                <p>Mum was a school guidance counselor and I'm sure she must have been breaking some confidentiality rules as she would often talk to us about what was happening for other kids at the school where she worked, nudging us to put ourselves in other kids' shoes. We had things like 'family circle' at home when someone was upset, where mum would get us to sit together and take turns passing around the 'talking stick', and if anyone tried to talk without the talking stick or the permission of the person holding it they would be swiftly shut up, so you'd walk through the issue hearing one person out at a time.</p>
                <p>Thinking back that was pretty cool, and I think set me up to manage interpersonal relationships a little bit better than I otherwise might have, so I'm thankful for that.</p>
                <p>And I'm stoked to learn how important emotional intelligence is in software development too. The last thing I want is to work with a bunch of robots so it's great EDA is focusing in on training more developers with the people-skills that make working together awesome, woop!</p>
                <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
                <p>Good. I especially liked the author's explanation of an even easier way to practice mindfulness being simply to sit there with no agenda. That's been something I'm really keen to train myself in, as I know how much more enjoyable it makes spending time with someone when you're not thinking about something else you need to be doing in the back of your mind, so I'm looking forward to practicing this. Since a theme of this prep course seems to be training sustainable habits, I'll set myself the goal of 2 minutes of mindfulness every lunchtime and go from there.</p>
