                <h2>Meditation Process</h2>
                <h4>A bit of a preamble...</h4>
                <p>While rebuilding this site with all the lego images and whatnot, I found it a bit difficult to apply the idea of 'process over product'.</p> 
                <p>I know this was a part of the assignment for a reason, but I still struggled at moments where the product I was trying to create - a relatively easy-on-the-eyes simple blog format - was being difficult to create, especially with fiddly things like media queries and balancing the grid system to keep content centered, and I couldn't just move on knowing I was at least using the right process because I clearly wasn't... One of the things I like most about code is that it's unambiguous logic. There's only one way the heirarchy of CSS rules are going to apply, it's not up for debate, so if it isn't displaying how you're trying to make it display, you've made a mistake!</p>
                <p>I'm sure I'm putting too much weight on the concept of 'process over product', but nonetheless I still feel that process creates product and they're interdependant in that sense. Maybe the assignment material just meant if you don't have a design you like, just focus on the process of wireframing and turning it into the visual display and don't worry if it's not pretty. Yeah actually it probably meant that didn't it. Oh well. I quite like all my legos and simple design so I guess the concept didn't really apply to me.</p>
                <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
                <p>I have mixed feelings about meditation. Mum has been meditating every day for the last 40 years and has time and again tried to encourage me to start. I enjoy it whenever I do, but I usually have an agenda in my free time and there's something else I'd rather be doing.</p>
                <p>So I went into the chapter slightly annoyed. Here's another person trying to get me to meditate. I know the benefits, I'm just choosing not to.</p>
                <h4>What new things have you learned about meditation?</h4>
                <p>Well I learned that it's actually something that I want to do. The chapter speaks a lot about attention, and training it like a muscle to notice when your mind wanders and gently bring you back. I'm unbelievably guilty of that, and would find myself getting a cup of tea, or thinking about something else after only a paragraph or so each time while reading. I know it's all good and well to be able to focus for long periods of time on something that I actually care about, but that's not the way life works, and there will always be things that I don't really want to do that I need to be able to focus on to get through. And that's something I'd love to train with meditation - the ability to calmly focus on something like reading a book about meditation!</p>
                <p>The other analogy that I loved in the book was the idea that the mind is like a bucket of water with lots of little bits of dirt and gravel. I'm constantly shaking mine, agitating it and jumping from this thought to the next, and it definitely feels murky a lot of the time. I'd like to be able to sit and leave my water still, until the gravel, or frantic thoughts and impulses that I need to be doing something or there's something I'm forgetting, can drift to the bottom and sit still.</p>
                <h4>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                <p>I'll follow the 'process meditation', through intention, attention, noticing distraction, and attitude. I like the idea of having a bit of a flow, I think while starting out it will help me focus - if there is something I was intending to do, like noticing that attitude I have about myself and my own distractions, when I notice my attention has drifted I'll be able to remind myself to let the thought pass and go back to noticing my attitude. If I had no structure, knowing me, I think I would spend the whole time in agitated random thought.</p>
                <p>Wow that is the most confusing sentence to go back and read.</p>
                <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>Yes! I have real trouble sleeping sometimes, and I find myself calming down a lot towards a sleepy feeling just reading the words in this chapter and focusing on my breathing. There have been a couple points throught this chapter and the last where the author spoke about sitting in a position that doesn't encourage sleep, and that the goal is not to fall asleep... But if I found myself falling asleep I definitely wouldn't have a problem with that. Might try to meditate myself to sleep tonight.</p>
