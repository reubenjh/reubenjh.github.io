                <h2>Daily Mindfullness</h2>
                <h4>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h4>
                <p>I'm writing this having just read the chapter, so haven't had this conversation with anyone yet, but I'm looking forward to it. I love the idea of applying mindfullness meditation techniques to informal conversations with random people or friends during the day too. A consistent thing I see in the people I love spending time with most, is that they really give you their full attention. I know I can do better at that myself as I find myself zoning back into conversations having missed a couple sentences. I notice when it happens to me so I'm sure others notice when I do it. So I'm looking forward to improving the level of attention I give to people in conversation.</p>
                <p>Another thought is that this would be incredibly useful for learning some of the concepts we find more difficult than others here at Dev Academy. If for example I was struggling with the underlying maths behind the JavaScript function Math.random() to produce random numbers between a given range, or how the difference between accessing properties in objects or using a variable to actually return the <em>value</em> of that property - which I am, it still flummoxes me - then it would be hugely beneficial to sit with someone and use my understanding of the concept as the topic of the mindfullness conversation. They could confirm back what it is they think I am saying, and once we've established that, give their own understanding of it while I listen mindfully before checking that I am understanding them correctly. Then we could swap to cover a topic they might be struggling with.</p>
                <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
                <p>My notes on this chapter are gold:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Start with one breath a day</li>
                        <li>Set your difficulty setting</li>
                        <li>First gear = joyful meditation</li>
                        <li>Other gears = sitting. More important to train attention in a neutral environment</li>
                        <li>Remeber I'm a zen walking baby</li>
                        <li>Win</li>
                    </ul>
                So it looks like pretty much all of them. I loved the idea to do less than you are capable of too as I know myself well and I'm definitely one to try to go really hard at something and burn out. If I can sit for 5 minutes before becoming distracted, start by doing 3 minutes so that It doesn't become a burden. Let it be an indulgence, like chocolate. Just because you've got a whole bar doesn't mean you should eat the whole thing. Don't ruin it.</p>
                <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>At the start of this course, the chapters in "Search Inside Yourself" felt like a chore. I would dread them. Now they are the part of the week I look forward to most :)</p>
