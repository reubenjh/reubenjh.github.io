                <h2>Self Confidence</h2>
                <h4>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                <p>The author suggests they are essentially the same thing - they are both describing the ability to maintain one's attention and onjectve view of the self, and the ability to notice when it wavers and bring it back. The author believes since mindfullness is trainable, and they are such similar concepts, then self-awareness is trainable too.</p>
                <h4>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h4>
                <p>I tried out body scan and found it really interesting to notice the unexpected sensations in places like the back of my head and inside of my throat. I found myself keeping attention better than regular meditation here as it felt more like there was a task - focus on the forehead, move to the eyes, move to the nose - than when the task itself is to relax and keep attention on breath and what I'm feeling.</p>
                <p>It's cool that the author talks about how this might help people sleep as many people fall asleep doing this, and I look forward to trying this in bed, but my first experience is that it might not be the best sleeping helper for me. One of the main things that I struggle with when trying to get to sleep is the sensation of needing to itch of scratch. It's like a mind-game where my brain says 'you need to scratch your foot', then the sensation appears and it's reeeally hard to ignore, then my brain says 'you need to scratch your head' and so on and so on, so I often toss and turn and scratch for quite a while until I can let my attention drift off. One thing I noticed while doing the body scan is tat it heightened this experience, making me need to scratch my head when I'm focusing on the feeling in my head, then needing to lick my lips when I move on to them etc. It was weird.</p>
                <h4>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h4>
                <p>I like the analogy of the coulds in the sky. If I'm the sky, the clouds are just fleeting experiences that might be good or bad, rainy or fluffy. The whole concept of your emotions or your behaviour not being 'who you are' is something I strongly believe in. And it gives a feeling of power, as ultimately I'm in charge.</p>
