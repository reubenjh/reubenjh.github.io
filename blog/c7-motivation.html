                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <h4>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h4>
                <p>Awesome. It's super interesting to think about how much of my own life is all about chasing the pleasure version of happiness. I think it would take a lot of discipline as we build up solid habits that are hard to break, but it be great to spend a lot more of that energy building a sustainable form of happiness in passion and purpose.</p>
                <h4>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise...</h4>
                <em><strong>What are your core values?</strong></em>
                <p>Kindness and happiness. Sounds too obvious but I really think they are.</p>
                <em><strong>What do you stand for?</strong></em>
                <p>Treating others how I want to be treated - with kindness. And looking out for people who are unable to look out for themselves.</p>
                <h4>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h4>
                <p>I like the idea that success and failure are just emotional experiences, and using the framework of grasping and aversion to understand I have power over them.</p>
                <h4>Any other musings?</h4>
                <p>To be honest, I find the chapters really difficult to get through when there hasn't been a huge amount of technical learning or challenge in the sprint. When there has been some serious technical challenge, I don't mind doing the reading and meditating as it feels like a nice break to do something completely different that I also think is important, but when there has only been 10 ish hours of content, I feel like I'm taking a break that I don't want yet. It's hard to stay focussed on the content of the readings when I don't want to do them as they are quite intellectual and conceptual.</p>
