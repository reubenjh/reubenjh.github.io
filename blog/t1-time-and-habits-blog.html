                <p>* <strong>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong>
                    <br>
                    I've used pomodoro technique in the past and found it extremely useful. I'm one to get lost down rabit-holes to be honest so I think timeboxing set amounts of times for tasks, setting myself however many pomodoros that will take, then reviewing where I'm at and how I'm going towards the goal at the end will be really important to build good habits and discipline.
                    <br><br>
                    To kick things off, the waffle task for this assignment says write a 'quick' blog. So I've set myself max 25 minutes, or one tomato, to get it done, as that's the max time I want to take.
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>What did you find interesting? And what worked for you?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The talk about building habits, about taking small actions to prove to yourself you can do it, and having the confidence come from there.
                    <br><br>
                    I liked the stuff about flow state too, as people generally see anxiety as a purely negative thing but those readings were talking about flow being when you find the perfect balance between boredom and anxiety, and that both are needed. I'm looking forweard to noticing when I get into a flow, and starting to reflect on what environment, mindset and actions led me there. I can't stress enough how much a related to the difference they were defining in one of the resources between flow state and hyperfocus: I think I fall into hyperfocus a lot, which is to just become hyper immersed in some aspect of a project for a long period of time, often to the detriment of the project as a whole.
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>What will you experiment with further?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Setting goals before beginning study on concepts, timeboxing, using the pomodoro timer while working for a sustainable approach and reflecting on those moments when I get on a role. I'm gonna go get myself a little handy timeboxing notebook in my next big pomodoro break.               
                    <br><br>
                    Reuben.
