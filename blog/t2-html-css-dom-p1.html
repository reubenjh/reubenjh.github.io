                <p>
                    While having a nosy around <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" target="_blank">CSS Zen Garden</a>, a couple designs jumped out. I really liked the side nav and solid background image underlay on <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/" target="_blank">design #220</a>, and <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/204/" target="_blank">design #204</a> hastily taught me to never ever use a black background since it makes the site look like your myspace or bebo profile from the early 2000's.      
                    <br><br>
                    I googled off to random sites to save some features to a wishlist, and ended up with these few things below:

                            <li>+ nav overlay and page header title overlay</li>

                    <li>Grid system like everywhere</li>

                <p>
                    As I'm sure you can see, that teeny weeny 'Top' button in the bottom right corner is my grand master work. He isn't nearly as beautiful as the one I was trying to copy from the website in bullet #2 above, or quite as functional mind you, but I'm proud of him. I'm hoping that soon enough I might be able to work out how to hide it until you're scrolling as it doesn't make much sense to appear while you're sitting at the top of the page already.

                <h3>Q's and A's</h3>
                <p>* <strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong>
                    <br>
                    There seems to be one most common analogy to describe the relationship here so for the sake of ease I'd use that - <em>building a house.</em> The HTML is your architect's blueprints, and defines the basic structure. It's your walls, your roof, where the doors go, what rooms there are etc. The CSS is the designer, and defines how things look. Your colours, features, making sure the feng shui is awesome. The DOM, as far as I can tell, is the construction company's best interpretation of how all your collective blueprints and design rules fit together to create a finished product, represented in one visual document.
                    <br><br>
                    In the world of websites, (I think) technically a browser arriving at your webpage sees your HTML and CSS and creates a DOM for the page for it to display. It might look identical to the HTML you wrote but it might not. Different browsers may interpret your code slightly differently to display slightly different things, or they may correct obvious errors such as a missing <code>tbody</code> element within your <code>table</code>, and simply insert the <code>tbody</code>
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong>
                    <br>
                    To boxify a design is to draw boxes around all of the distinct objects and elements in a design to ascertain their relative position and relationship to one another - i.e. which boxes are within other boxes.
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>What is the box model?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The box model is a CSS design and layout model that considers all HTML elements "boxes", consisting of 4 layers: "content", "padding", "border" and "margin".
                    <br><br>
                    <img id="box-model-img" src="../images/box-model.png" alt="The Box Model">
                    <br><br>
                    This allows us to define the size of any html element and the space between.
                    <br><br>
