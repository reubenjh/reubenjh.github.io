                <p>* <strong>What is grid based design?</strong>
                    <br>
                    A design philosophy where you create a grid structure dividing the page up into columns and rows to house all of your elements. This makes it easy to lay out our elements in a visually appealling way.

                    * <strong>What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Web traffic isn't only from computers, a huge portion actually browse on mobile phones or tablets, and each of those devices have very different screen sizes. You don't want your webpage to only work for some of those screen sizes and looked smooshed or unreadable on some, so web designers need to make webpages 'responsive', meaning they will respond to the size of the screen viewing it and adjust css accordingly to create a suitable design. People have pretty short attention spans so you'll lose them quick if your website looks like this on a phone:

                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>What is semantic structure?</strong>
                    <br>
                    The structure of what each section <em>means</em>. It's tags like <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>section</code> and <code>footer</code>, making the code easier for someone else to understand, and easier to target certain areas with css that occur across multiple pages like a navigation bar.
                    <br><br>
                    * <strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</strong>
                    <br>
                    Nope, all hunky-dory.
