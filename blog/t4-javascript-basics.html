                <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
                <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p>Holy crap. It's so much more difficult. Maybe it's just because I had done a bit of HTML and CSS before so I'm having a bit of shock seeing a new language, but this week has been real hard. It's mathsy and logicy, which I like but find really hard to wrap my brain around.</p>
                <p>I stopped at one point when it was making almost no sense and read through the Sprint 4 overview resources. One of those was a guide to pseudocoding, which is the process of writing out what you want your code to do on paper in more plain english terms to help you get your mind around what you're trying to do, or share it with someone else, before doing all the fiddly bits of syntax specific to JavaScript. I found that really useful over the course of the next 15 or so hours I was lost in the freecodecamp course.</p>
                <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
                <p>xxx</p>
                <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
                <p>To access data in an array, you need to target it's 'index', or 'numerical position in the array'. These are represented by a number appended at the end of a variable in square brackets. Just to make life a bit more nonsensical, the count starts at <em>0</em>, as opposed to <em>1</em>, since computers start counting from 0. So the left-most item in an array is index 0, the next index 1 and so on and so on.</p>
                <p>Objects, on the other hand, store their data in a more human way by organising it into 'properties'. To access an object's data you need only to refer to the property that you're concerned with .......</p>
                <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
                <p>Functions are a repeatable bit of code that you can run on some arguments. They're useful as you only need to write out the function you want your JavaScript to perform once, then do it by calling the name of the function at any time. The arguments that it performs the code in question on can change. You could write a function to convert Celcius temperature to Fahrenheit, then call the function with the Celcius in brackets and it will spit out the converted Fahrenheit for you.</p>
