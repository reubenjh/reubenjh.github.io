                <p>The gif says it all. Training to be an elite computer programmerer.</p>

                <p>I used to work for <a href="https://www.onepercentcollective.org" target="_blank">One Percent Collective</a> as their Head of Digital, which cracked both myself and the only other team member Pat up since I was the only person in the digi team anyway. I loved it, but doing a bit of everything just isn't for me. Taking the plunge into tech now.</p>
